# Step 0: Get the resources to follow this tutorial

Get the sources from the repository.

Clone it with Git into your local folder (change `my-local-folder` to what you want):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nhoizey/images-responsiver.git my-local-folder
```

Then go into the first example folder with your terminal:

```bash
cd my-local-folder/docs/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/tutorial/01-without-plugin
```

And let's go for **[step 1](../01-without-plugin/#readme)**!
